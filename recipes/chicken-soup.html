        <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
            <p>This is one of the meals that I began batch-making at the end of the weekend so that I could have meals pre-prepared for after work, so I was less likely to eat something quick and unhealthy.</p>
            <p>Traditionally, I was never really into soups and such for dinner but I have come around on that recently having actually ventured into making the soups myself. I grew up eating a lot of packaged or canned soups and it is much, much tastier to make them yourself. </p>
            <p>I will typically enjoy this alongside a salad or a BLT.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbps olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 carrots, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>3-4 stalks of celery, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2 gloves garlic (or 2 tbps jarlic)</li>
            <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
            <li>2 900ml cartons of chicken broth</li>
            <li>Poultry seasoning, to taste</li>
            <li>Your favourite pasta</li>
            <li>Thyme, to taste</li>
            <li>Italian seasoning, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li><em>Optional</em>: 1 bay leaf</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <p>Unlike other recipes I will make, this one is a bit harder to write down because I kind of eyeball a lot of different aspects of it. Even carrots/celery may depend on how big the ones I have available are.</p>
        <p>Pasta amount isn't given above, and won't really be accounted for below either. I make a giant pot of soup that lasts me for multiple meals, and I cook fresh pasta with leftovers instead of cooking it directly in the soup. This keeps the pasta from getting very soggy in future portions.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Bake the chicken breasts. My preferred method is in the air frier. I coat the outside of the chicken lightly with olive oil, salt and pepper, and then put it in at 200c. After 12 minutes, flip the chicken and do the same on the other side for another 12. Once it has cooked fully, shred or cut up the chicken into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li>Saute onions, carrots and celery in olive oil in a large pot medium-high heat. Once vegetables hit your preferred done-ness, Add garlic, cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add your cut up chicken to the pot, along with a generous amount of poultry seasoning, a bit of salt and pepper, and some thyme and italian seasoning. Give everything a good mix.</li>
            <li>Add chicken broth and turn heat up to high. If you so choose, at this stage you can add the bay leaf.</li>
            <li>I will typically cook on high until the pot starts to boil. While I do this, I will put out a smaller pot of heavily salted water over high heat, and add 2 handfuls of pasta per person.</li>
            <li>Once pasta is cooked and soup is boiling, turn both off. Remove the bay leaf. Drain pasta and add to bowls first, followed by adding in the finished soup. The remaining soup can be put into containers and frozen or refrigerated.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
