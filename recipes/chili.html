        <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
            <p>This is one of the meals that I began batch-making at the end of the weekend so that I could have meals pre-prepared for after work, so I was less likely to eat something quick and unhealthy.</p>
            <p>It's a delicious and filling dish, and while I got the outline of the recipe from somewhere online, I have added to it to make it my own.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbps olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 peppers, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups frozen corn</li>
            <li>2 gloves garlic (or 2 tbps jarlic)</li>
            <li>2 lbs of ground beef</li>
            <li>1 28oz can chili-flavoured diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 16oz cans kidney beans (whichever colour you prefer)</li>
            <li>2 small cans of tomato paste (or a 15oz container of tomato puree)</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>3 tbsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chipotle powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cumin</li>
            <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Saute onions in olive oil in a large pan on medium-high heat. Once softened slightly and add in ground beef. Cook until no more pink remains. Add garlic, cook for another minute, and then remove and add to the slow cooker. </li>
            <li>Using same pan, saute mushrooms and peppers. Once done, also place in the pot.</li>
            <li>Take your tomato paste and put it into a bowl or pot. Add in about half of one of the cans worth of water and mix together until you have a slightly thinner consistency. Add to pot. The original recipe called for tomato puree and I have yet to come across it so I have just taken to thinning out tomato paste instead. This step may be redundent once you have added in extra water to the recipe but I am a creature of habit.</li>
            <li>Mix corn, tomatoes, kidney beans and 1 cup of water into the pot.</li>
            <li>Time for the spices! Chili powder, chipotle powder, smoked paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, and cinnamon stick </li>
            <li>Mix everything together and let it cook on low for 6 hours.</li>
            <li>The chili is ready to serve - enjoy! You can add cheddar cheese or sour cream as a topping and serve with warm buns, salad or corn chips. There are many possibilities!</li>
