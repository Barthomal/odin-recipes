        <h2>Recipe Decription</h2>
            <p>This is one of the meals that I began batch-making at the end of the weekend so that I could have meals pre-prepared for after work, so I was less likely to eat something quick and unhealthy.</p>
            <p>It's a delicious and filling dish, and while I got the outline of the recipe from somewhere online, I have added to it to make it my own.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbps olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>2 peppers, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups frozen corn</li>
            <li>2 gloves garlic (or 2 tbps jarlic)</li>
            <li>2 lbs of ground beef</li>
            <li>1 28oz can chili-flavoured diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 16oz cans kidney beans (whichever colour you prefer)</li>
            <li>2 small cans of tomato paste (or a 15oz container of tomato puree)</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>3 tbsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chipotle powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cumin</li>
            <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Saute onions in olive oil in a large pan on medium-high heat. Once softened slightly and add in ground beef. Cook until no more pink remains. Add garlic, cook for another minute, and then remove and add to the slow-cooker. </li>
            <li>Using same pan, saute mushrooms and peppers. Once done, also place in the pot.</li>
            <li>Take your tomato paste and put it into a bowl or pot. Add in about half of one of the cans worth of water and mix together until you have a slightly thinner consistency. Add to pot. The original recipe called for tomato puree and I have yet to come across it so I have just taken to thinning out tomato paste instead. This step may be redundent once you have added in extra water to the recipe but I am a creature of habit.</li>
            <li>Mix corn, tomatoes, kidney beans and 1 cup of water in the pot.</li>
            <li>Time for the spices! Chili powder, chipotle powder, smoked paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, and cinnamon stick </li>
            <li>Mix everything together and let it cook on low for 6 hours.</li>
            <li>The chili is ready to serve - enjoy! You can add cheddar cheese or sour cream as a topping and serve with warm buns, salad or corn chips. There are many possibilities!</li>
