        <img title="Big chonky beef" src="../img/stew.jpg" alt="Bowl of delicious beef stew">
        <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
            <p>I added this to my meal-prep repertoire when I was looking for something to eat once the cooler weather hit. Stews were never something that were really eaten in our house growing up so I thought I would experiment and pull a recipe from online.</p>
            <p>This is a delicious meal that I will typically serve with garlic bread. I am getting hungry as I write this.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbps olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 medium carrots, diced</li>
            <li>3 medium celery stalks, diced</li>
            <li>2 cups frozen peas</li>
            <li>2 gloves garlic (or 2 tbps jarlic)</li>
            <li>1 package sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>3 cups halved baby potatoes</li>
            <li>1 large package of stewing beef</li>
            <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 900ml carton beef broth with red wine</li>
            <li>1 900ml carton beef broth</li>
            <li>1 cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 1/2 tsp italian herb blend</li>
            <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp fresh chopped parsley for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add beef to pre-heated frying pan with oil. Season with salt and fry until well-browned. Transfer beef into crock pot. Deglaze pan using 1/2 of water and add the flavourful liquid to the crock pot sa well.</li>
            <li>In the same pan add 1 tbsp of il and your mirpoix - carrots, celery and onion. After several minutes of letting the vegetables sweat and saute, add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes. Add this mixture to the crock pot.</li>
            <li>Once again in the same pot, add butter and let it melt. Add the mushooms in and brown them up. Season with salt and pepper, and then add the flour. Evenly coat the mushrooms in the flour and let cook for another minute, before adding them to the pot.</li>
            <li>Add in both of your different beef broths, tomato sauce, Worcestershire, spices and herbs. Season generously with salt and paper. </li>
            <li>Add in the peas and baby potatoes. Mix to combine everything.</li>
            <li>It should be good to sit in the pot for several hours. Personally, I like to leave it in for 8ish hours on slow if I am able, as I like when the beef becomes very tender.</li>
            <li>Add parsley for garnish.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
